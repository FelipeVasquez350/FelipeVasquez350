  <h3  align="center">I'm just a software developer whose will to code is inversely proportional to the time I have for it, probably because I would spend too much time on it otherwise Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</h3>

  <h4 align="center"> You may see me do things every once in a while, usually not public until most of it is done or at least works, unless i forget to publish them. </h4>

  Also a homelab enthusiast and fan of mechs, because who doesn't like big robots and flashy explosions. (Never watched Gundam or sorts tho)

### Discord Bots

-   [CTPBot](https://github.com/FelipeVasquez350/CTPBot) Discord bot for the Terraria Calamity Texturepack that made me write over 100k lines of json manually
-   [Lucius V](https://github.com/FelipeVasquez350/Lucius-V) Discord bot inspired by [GenAi](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/974297735559806986), mostly because the creator in their github profile put "please no rust ðŸš€ðŸ¦€ðŸ’¥", no this is not a joke
-   [Lucius VII](https://github.com/FelipeVasquez350/Lucius-VII) (ON HOLD) A redesigned iteration that utilizes [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to run a large language model (LLM) for generating the bot's responses. Written in haskell because it felt too easy and also wanted to hurt myself

### Contributions

-   [AerovelenceMod](https://github.com/Arcri/AerovelenceMod) A mod for the game Terraria that i contributed for a short amount of time
-   [Original CTPBot](https://github.com/daim0/CTPBot) A discord bot that i ended up taking over and rewriting in [what it is now](https://github.com/FelipeVasquez350/CTPBot)
